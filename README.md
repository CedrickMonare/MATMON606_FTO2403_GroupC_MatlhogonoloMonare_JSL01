In this project I had to write a function that takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax then it should return "Valid Syntax"; otherwise it should return "Invalid Syntax.". The function I used for this was the regular expression function to combine the "pet_" syntax along with different numbers and letters. It took me some time to figure out exactly which function would be appropriate for this but I eventually found the solution.
